# Generating the Inventory SQLite Script with Copilot AI

This document provides steps to generate the inventory management system script using Copilot AI. The script is designed to create and manage an inventory system efficiently, leveraging Copilot AI to streamline the development process.

## Steps to Regenerate the Script

1. **Prompt Copilot AI**  
   Use a clear and concise prompt to describe the schema requirements. For example:
   ```
   Create an SQLite script for an inventory management system with the following:
   - A `suppliers` table with columns: `supplier_id` (primary key), `name`, `contact_info`.
   - A `categories` table with columns: `category_id` (primary key), `name`, `supplier_id` (foreign key referencing suppliers).
   - A `products` table with columns: `product_id` (primary key), `name`, `price`, `category_id` (foreign key referencing categories).
   - A `product_list` view combining product, category, and supplier details.
   ```

2. **Review the Generated Script**  
   Carefully review the script generated by Copilot AI to ensure it meets the requirements and adheres to best practices.

3. **Test the Script**  
   Execute the script in an SQLite environment to verify that:
   - Tables are created correctly.
   - Foreign key constraints are enforced.
   - Sample data is inserted as expected.
   - The `product_list` view returns the correct data.

4. **Iterate if Necessary**  
   If the script does not meet the requirements, refine the prompt and regenerate the script using Copilot AI.

5. **Save and Document**  
   Once the script is finalized, save it and update this README file to reflect any changes or additional instructions.
